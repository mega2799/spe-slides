## Motivation and context

- General need: govern the deployment of software systems onto some infrastructure
    + software system -> multiple interacting software components (processes), each one having its runtime requirements
    + infrastructure -> the available hardware and software substratum (one or more machines)
    + deployment -> orderly instantiation of the software components, while optimising hardware exploitation

- Need for multi-tenancy (i.e. sharing) on hardware resources
- Need for isolation
- Need to formalize / control / reproduce the runtime environment of applications
- Need to automate deployment of applications into production / testing environments

## Background and nomenclature

- VM and VMH
    + IaaS

- Containers and containers engines
    + orchestration
